    <h1>Electric Vehicle</h1>
    <p>An electric vehicle (EV) is one that operates on an electric motor, instead of an internal-combustion engine that
        generates power by burning a mix of fuel and gases.<br>
        Electric Vehicles (EV’s) include, road and rail vehicles, surface and underwater vessels, electric aircraft and
        electric spacecraft.<br>
        Though the concept of electric vehicles has been around for a long time, it has drawn a considerable amount of
        interest in the past decade amid a rising carbon footprint and other environmental impacts of fuel-based
        vehicles.<br>
        An electric vehicle may be powered through a collector system by electricity from off-vehicle sources, or may be
        self-contained with a battery, solar panels, fuel cells or an electric generator to convert fuel to
        electricity.<br>

    <h2>Electric Vehicles – 8 Different Types</h2>
    <p><em>Electric Vehicles can be broadly classified into 8 different types.</em></p>
    <ol>
        <li>Plug-in Electric Vehicle </li>
        <li>On- and Off-road Electric Vehicles</li>
        <li>Space Rover Vehicles</li>
        <li>Seaborne Electric Vehicles</li>
        <li>Airborne Electric Vehicles</li>
        <li>Electrically Powered Spacecraft</li>
        <li>Range-extended electric vehicle</li>
        <li>Railborne Electric Vehicles</li>
    </ol>
    <h2>Plug-in Electric Vehicle (PEV)</h2>
    <p>A plug-in electric vehicle (PEV) is any motor vehicle that can be recharged from any external source of
        electricity, such as wall sockets, and the electricity stored in the Rechargeable battery packs drives.</p>
    <p><strong>Plug-in Electric Vehicles can be further categorized into</strong></p>
    <ol>
        <li>Plug-in Hybrid Electric vehicles, (PHEVs)</li>
        <li>Battery electric vehicles (BEVs)</li>
    </ol>
    <p><strong>Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicles (PHEV)</strong></p>
    <ol>
        <li>A plug-in hybrid electric vehicle (PHEV) is a hybrid electric vehicle whose battery can be recharged by
            plugging it
            into an external source of electric power, as well as by its on-board engine and generator.</li>
        <li>Most PHEVs are passenger cars, but there are also PHEV versions of commercial vehicles and vans, military
            vehicles,
            utility trucks, trains, motorcycles, buses and mopeds.</li>
    </ol>
    <h2>Advantages of Electric Vehicles</h2>
    <p><em>Electric Vehicles – <strong>Environmental Advantages</strong></em></p>
    <p>Electric cars (or electric vehicles, EVs) have several environmental benefits compared to conventional internal
        combustion engine cars.</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Have the potential to reduce greenhouse gas emissions</li>
        <li>Reduce dependence on petroleum</li>
        <li>Reduce health effects from air pollution</li>
        <li>Reduce dependence on petroleum</li>
        <li>They produce little or no tailpipe emissions
        </li>
    </ol>
    <p><em>Electric Vehicles – <strong>Mechanical Advantages</strong></em></p>
    <ol>
        <li>They can be finely controlled and provide high torque from rest, unlike internal combustion engines, and do not need
            multiple gears to match power curves. Hence it removes the requirement for gearboxes and torque converters.</li>
        <li>Lesser vibration</li>
        <li>Lesser noise</li>
        <li>Electric motors are mechanically very simple and often achieve 90% energy conversion efficiency over the full range
            of speeds and power output and can be precisely controlled.</li>
    </ol>
