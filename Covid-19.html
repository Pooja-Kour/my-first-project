    <h1>CORONAVIRUS (COVID-19)</h1>
    <p>
      Coronaviruses are a family of viruses that can cause respiratory illness
      in humans. They are called “corona” because of crown-like spikes on the
      surface of the virus. Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), Middle
      East respiratory syndrome (MERS) and the common cold are examples of
      coronaviruses that cause illness in humans. The new strain of coronavirus
      — SARS-CoV-2 — was first reported in Wuhan, China in December 2019. It has
      since spread to every country around the world.

    <h2>Where do coronaviruses come from?</h2>
    <p>
      Coronaviruses are often found in bats, cats and camels. The viruses live
      in but don’t infect the animals. Sometimes these viruses then spread to
      different animal species. The viruses may change (mutate) as they transfer
      to other species. Eventually, the virus can jump from animal species and
      begin to infect humans. In the case of SARS-CoV-19, the first people
      infected are thought to have contracted the virus at a food market that
      sold meat, fish and live animals.
