    <h1>MERN Full Stack</h1>
    <h2>What is the MERN stack?</h2>
    <p>A technology stack can be custom (developers can choose the technologies depending on their project requirements)
        or
        pre-built (where the technologies have been pre-decided).<br>

        <strong>MERN</strong> is a pre-built technology stack based on JavaScript technologies. <strong>MERN</strong>
        stands for <em>MongoDB, Express, React, and
            Node,</em> after the four key technologies that make up the stack.
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>MongoDB — document database</li>
        <li>Express(.js) — Node.js web framework</li>
        <li>React(.js) — a client-side JavaScript framework</li>
        <li>Node(.js) — the premier JavaScript web server (runtime)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Express and Node make up the middle (application) tier. Express.js is a server-side web framework, and Node.js is
        the popular and powerful JavaScript server platform. Regardless of which variant you choose, ME(RVA)N is the
        ideal
        approach to working with JavaScript and JSON, all the way through.</p>
    <h2>How does the MERN stack work?</h2>
    <p>The MERN architecture allows you to easily construct a three-tier architecture (front end, back end, database)
        entirely using JavaScript and JSON.</p>
    <h3>React.js front end</h3>
    <p>The top tier of the MERN stack is <mark>React.js</mark>, the declarative JavaScript framework for creating
        dynamic client-side applications in HTML. React lets you build
        complex interfaces through simple components, connect them to data on your back-end server, and render them as
        HTML.<br>
        React's strong suit is handling stateful, data-driven interfaces with minimal code and hassle, and it has all
        the
        features you'd expect from a modern web framework: great support for forms, error handling, events, lists, and
        more.</p>
    <h3>Express.js and Node.js server tier</h3>
    <p>The next level down is the Express.js server-side framework, running inside a <mark>Node.js</mark> server.
        Express.js bills itself as a “fast, unopinionated, minimalist web framework for Node.js,” and that is indeed
        exactly what it is. Express.js has powerful models for URL routing (matching an incoming URL with a server
        function), and handling HTTP requests and responses.<br>

        By making XML HTTP Requests (XHRs), GETs, or POSTs from your React.js front end, you can connect to Express.js
        functions that power your application. Those functions, in turn, use MongoDB's Node.js drivers, to access and
        update
        data in your MongoDB database.</p>
    <h3>MongoDB database tier</h3>
    <p>If your application stores any data (user profiles, content, comments, uploads, events, etc.), then you're going to
        want a database that's just as easy to work with as React,Express, and Node.js.<br>
    
        That's where <mark>MongoDB</mark> comes in: JSON documents created in your React.js front end can be sent to the Express.js
        server, where they can be processed and (assuming they're valid) stored directly in MongoDB for later retrieval.
        Again, if you're building in the cloud, you'll want to look at
        MongoDB Atlas</p>
