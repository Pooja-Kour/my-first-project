    <h1>Cloud Computing</h1>
    <p>Cloud computing refers to the use of hosted services, such as data storage, servers, databases, networking, and
        software over the internet. The data is stored on physical servers, which are maintained by a cloud service
        provider. Computer system resources, especially data storage and computing power, are available on-demand,
        without direct management by the user in cloud computing.<br>
        Instead of storing files on a storage device or hard drive, a user can save them on cloud, making it possible to
        access the files from anywhere, as long as they have access to the web. The services hosted on cloud can be
        broadly divided into infrastructure-as-a-service (IaaS), platform-as-a-service (PaaS), and software-as-a-service
        (SaaS). Based on the deployment model, cloud can also be classified as public, private, and hybrid cloud.<br>

        Further, cloud can be divided into two different layers, namely, front-end and back-end. The layer with which
        users interact is called the front-end layer. This layer enables a user to access the data that has been stored
        in cloud through cloud computing software.<br>

        The layer made up of software and hardware, i.e., the computers, servers, central servers, and databases, is the
        back-end layer. This layer is the primary component of cloud and is entirely responsible for storing information
        securely. To ensure seamless connectivity between devices linked via cloud computing, the central servers use a
        software called middlewareOpens a new window that acts as a bridge between the database and applications.</p>
    <h2>Types of Cloud Computing</h2>
    <p>Cloud computing can either be classified based on the deployment model or the type of service. Based on the
        specific deployment model, we can classify cloud as public, private, and hybrid cloud. At the same time, it can
        be classified as infrastructure-as-a-service (IaaS), platform-as-a-service (PaaS), and software-as-a-service
        (SaaS) based on the service the cloud model offers.</p>
    <h3>Private cloud</h3>
    <p>In a private cloud, the computing services are offered over a private IT network for the dedicated use of a
        single organization. Also termed internal, enterprise, or corporate cloud, a private cloud is usually managed
        via internal resources and is not accessible to anyone outside the organization. Private cloud computing
        provides all the benefits of a public cloud, such as self-service, scalability, and elasticity, along with
        additional control, security, and customization.</p>
    <h3>Public cloud</h3>
    <p>Public cloud refers to computing services offered by third-party providers over the internet. Unlike private
        cloud, the services on public cloud are available to anyone who wants to use or purchase them. These services
        could be free or sold on-demand, where users only have to pay per usage for the CPU cycles, storage, or
        bandwidth they consume.</p>
    <h3>Hybrid cloud</h3>
    <p>Hybrid cloud uses a combination of public and private cloud features. The “best of both worlds” cloud model
        allows a shift of workloads between private and public clouds as the computing and cost requirements change.
        When the demand for computing and processing fluctuates, hybrid cloudOpens a new window allows businesses to
        scale their on-premises infrastructure up to the public cloud to handle the overflow while ensuring that no
        third-party data centers have access to their data.</p>
    <h3>Infrastructure as a service (IaaS)</h3>
    <p>Infrastructure as a service or IaaS is a type of cloud computing in which a service provider is responsible for
        providing servers, storage, and networking over a virtual interface. In this service, the user doesn’t need to
        manage the cloud infrastructure but has control over the storage, operating systems, and deployed applications.
    </p>
    <h3>Platform as a service (PaaS)</h3>
    <p>Platform as a service or PaaS is a type of cloud computing that provides a development and deployment
        environment in cloud that allows users to develop and run applications without the complexity of building or
        maintaining the infrastructure. It provides users with resources to develop cloud-based applications. In this
        type of service, a user purchases the resources from a vendor on a pay-as-you-go basis and can access them over
        a secure connection</p>
    <h3>Software as a service (SaaS)</h3>
    <p>SaaS or software as a service allows users to access a vendor’s software on cloud on a subscription basis. In
        this type of cloud computing, users don’t need to install or download applications on their local devices.
        Instead, the applications are located on a remote cloud network that can be directly accessed through the web or
        an API.</p>
