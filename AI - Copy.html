    <h1>Artificial Intelligence (AI)</h1>
    <p><img src="https://d3njjcbhbojbot.cloudfront.net/api/utilities/v1/imageproxy/https://images.ctfassets.net/wp1lcwdav1p1/WLP03Kh71Uik4M1TNEyis/1605760b9f9f6b5b890e0d7b704ded5c/GettyImages-1199128740.jpg?w=1500&h=680&q=60&fit=fill&f=faces&fm=jpg&fl=progressive&auto=format%2Ccompress&dpr=1&w=1000" alt="AI image" width="400" height="300"><br>
      Artificial intelligence (AI) refers to computer systems capable of
      performing complex tasks that historically only a human could do, such as
      reasoning, making decisions, or solving problems.<br />

      Today, the term “AI” describes a wide range of technologies that power
      many of the services and goods we use every day – from apps that recommend
      tv shows to chatbots that provide customer support in real time. But do
      all of these really constitute artificial intelligence as most of us
      envision it? And if not, then why do we use the term so often?<br />

      In this article, you’ll learn more about artificial intelligence, what it
      actually does, and different types of it. In the end, you’ll also learn
      about some of its benefits and dangers and explore flexible courses that
      can help you expand your knowledge of AI even further.<br />

      program offered by DeepLearning.AI. In just 6 hours, you'll gain
      foundational knowledge about AI terminology, strategy, and the workflow of
      machine learning projects. Your first week is free.<br />
      Artificial intelligence (AI) is the theory and development of computer
      systems capable of performing tasks that historically required human
      intelligence, such as recognizing speech, making decisions, and
      identifying patterns. AI is an umbrella term that encompasses a wide
      variety of technologies, including <a href="https://www.coursera.org/articles/what-is-machine-learning">machine learning</a>, <a href="https://www.coursera.org/articles/what-is-deep-learning">deep learning</a>, and
      <a href="https://www.coursera.org/articles/natural-language-processing">natural language processing (NLP)</a>.<br> 
      Although the term is commonly used to describe a range of different technologies in use today, many disagree on
      whether these actually constitute artificial intelligence. Instead, some
      argue that much of the technology used in the real world today actually
      constitutes highly advanced machine learning that is simply a first step
      towards true artificial intelligence, or “general artificial intelligence”
      (GAI).<br> 
      Yet, despite the many philosophical disagreements over whether
      “true” intelligent machines actually exist, when most people use the term
      <a href="https://www.coursera.org/articles/what-does-ai-stand-for">AI</a> today, they’re referring to a suite of machine learning-powered
      technologies, such as <a href="https://www.coursera.org/articles/chatgpt">Chat GPT</a> or computer vision, that enable machines to
      perform tasks that previously only humans can do like generating written
      content, steering a car, or analyzing data.

    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>ChatGPT:</strong> Uses large language models (LLMs) to generate
        text in response to questions or comments posed to it.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Google Translate:</strong> Uses deep learning algorithms to
        translate text from one language to another.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Netflix:</strong> Uses machine learning algorithms to create
        personalized recommendation engines for users based on their previous
        viewing history.
