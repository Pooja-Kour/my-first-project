    <h1>Artificial Intelligence (AI)</h1>
    <p>
      Artificial intelligence (AI) refers to computer systems capable of
      performing complex tasks that historically only a human could do, such as
      reasoning, making decisions, or solving problems.<br />

      Today, the term “AI” describes a wide range of technologies that power
      many of the services and goods we use every day – from apps that recommend
      tv shows to chatbots that provide customer support in real time. But do
      all of these really constitute artificial intelligence as most of us
      envision it? And if not, then why do we use the term so often?<br />

      In this article, you’ll learn more about artificial intelligence, what it
      actually does, and different types of it. In the end, you’ll also learn
      about some of its benefits and dangers and explore flexible courses that
      can help you expand your knowledge of AI even further.<br />
