    <h1>BITCOIN</h1>
    <p>
      Bitcoin is a form of digital currency that aims to eliminate the need for
      central authorities such as banks or governments. Instead, Bitcoin uses
      blockchain technology to support peer-to-peer transactions between users
      on a decentralized network.<br />
      Transactions are authenticated through Bitcoin’s <a href="https://www.nerdwallet.com/article/investing/proof-of-work">proof-of-work</a> consensus
      mechanism, which rewards cryptocurrency miners for validating
      transactions.
    </p>
    <h2>How does Bitcoin work?</h2>
    <p>
      Each Bitcoin is a digital Blockchain: Bitcoin is powered by open-source
      code known as blockchain, which creates a shared public history of
      transactions organized into "blocks" that are "chained" together to
      prevent tampering. This technology creates a permanent record of each
      transaction, and it provides a way for every Bitcoin user to operate with
      the same understanding of who owns what.asset that can be stored at a
      cryptocurrency exchange or in a digital wallet. Each individual coin
      represents the value of Bitcoin’s current price, but you can also own
      partial shares of each coin. The smallest denomination of each Bitcoin is
      called a Satoshi, sharing its name with Bitcoin’s creator. Each Satoshi is
      equivalent to a hundred millionth of one Bitcoin, so owning fractional
      shares of Bitcoin is quite common.

      <strong>Blockchain:</strong> Bitcoin is powered by open-source code known
      as blockchain, which creates a shared public history of transactions
      organized into "blocks" that are "chained" together to prevent tampering.
      This technology creates a permanent record of each transaction, and it
      provides a way for every Bitcoin user to operate with the same
      understanding of who owns what.<br />
      <strong>Private and public keys:</strong> A Bitcoin wallet contains a
      public key and a private key, which work together to allow the owner to
      initiate and digitally sign transactions. This unlocks the central
      function of Bitcoin — securely transferring ownership from one user to
      another.<br />
      <strong>Bitcoin mining:</strong> Users on the Bitcoin network verify
      transactions through a process known as mining, which is designed to
      confirm that new transactions are consistent with other transactions that
      have been completed in the past. This ensures that you can’t spend a
      Bitcoin you don’t have, or that you have previously spent.
    </p>
    <h2>How does Bitcoin make money?</h2>
    <p>
      New Bitcoins are created as part of the Bitcoin mining process, in which
      they are offered as a lucrative reward to people who operate computer
      systems that help to validate transactions. Bitcoin miners — also known as
      "nodes" — are the owners of high speed computers which independently
      confirm each transaction, and add a completed "block" of transactions to
      the ever-growing "chain." The resulting blockchain is a complete, public
      and permanent record of every Bitcoin transaction.<br />
      Miners are then paid in Bitcoin for their efforts, which incentivizes the
      decentralized network to independently verify each transaction. This
      independent network of miners also decreases the chance for fraud or false
      information to be recorded, as the majority of miners need to confirm the
      authenticity of each block of data before it's added to the blockchain in
      a process known as proof-of-work.

          Cost-efficient transactions and fast speeds. Once you own Bitcoin, you
          can make transfers anytime, anywhere, reducing the time and potential
          expense of any transaction.
        </td>

          Price volatility. While Bitcoin's value has risen dramatically over
          the years, buyers' fortunes have varied widely depending on the timing
          of their investment. Those who bought in 2017 when Bitcoin’s price was
          racing toward $20,000, for example, had to wait until December 2020 to
          recover their losses. More recently, Bitcoin’s price began 2023
          slightly under $17,000 per coin, and hit new record highs in March
          2024.

          Privacy. Transactions don’t contain personal information, such as a
          name or credit card number. While it’s still possible to link a
          certain person to a certain wallet, transactions are generally more
          private than credit card transactions, for example.
        </td>
        <td>
          Hacking concerns. While backers say the blockchain technology behind
          Bitcoin is even more secure than traditional electronic money
          transfers, there have been a number of high-profile hacks. In May
          2019, for instance, more than $40 million in Bitcoin was stolen from
          several high-net-worth accounts on the cryptocurrency exchange
          Binance. (The company covered the losses.)

          Decentralization. After the financial crisis and the Great Recession,
          some investors are eager to embrace an alternative, decentralized
          currency — one that is essentially outside the control of regular
          banks, governing authorities or other third parties.

        <td>
          Not protected by SIPC. The Securities Investor Protection Corporation
          insures investors up to $500,000 if a brokerage fails or funds are
          stolen, but that insurance doesn’t cover cryptocurrency
